0.3-1
   - replaced the function mapply with its wrapper Map.
   - added the parameter dfix to the internal fucntion stima_cop
    it sets the parameter df.fixed=TRUE in tCopula

0.3-0
   - cleaned and optimized the internal functions;
   - the selection of the k-plets now uses the pairwise Spearman's rho
    together with a combination function fun which is now user defined (used to be the max function).

0.2-9
   - added a control on the dimension of the matrix of observations to be allocated (m2)
   - added a control on the row index matrix of observations to be allocated (RV2) post selection of the number of clusters.

0.2-8
   - eliminated the hideWarnings in the loglikCopula function because it deprecated and no
	longer used; the warning messages are now suppressed by suppressWarnings(.).

0.2-7
   - made the package compliant with the changes in version 0.999-0 of the copula package.

0.2-6
   - fixed one buglet
   - fixed one incompatibility on rgamma with the latest R-devel version in the example.

0.2-5
   - eliminated the double computation (before and after the choice of K) of the first part of the classification (on which K is
	chosen) and modified part of the code accordingly.
   - added a control on the dimension of matrice.indici3 and index.matrix.
   - added the slot Dependence to the output. It contains information on the fitted copula model.

0.2-4
   - added a check on the possibility of forming a new k-plet candidate to the allocation by means of the remaining observations
	at step i.

0.2-3
    - added the check on the finiteness of the loglikelihood of the copula fit; modified several portions of the
        code accordingly.
0.2-2
    - set  noc = 4.
    - added some checks on dimset and noc.
    - changed the check on the loglikelihood of the estimated copula in CoClust_perm.
    - added the citation file.
    - updated the documentation on the penalty term.
    - changed the name of the slot BIC into LLC in the S4 CoClust-class.
0.2-1
    - added the slot Index.dimset.
    - added the penalty switch.

0.2-0
    - revised version of the package and of the algorithm.
